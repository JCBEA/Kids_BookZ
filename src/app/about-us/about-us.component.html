                <p>The vision of Read to a Child is to provide every child with the opportunity to succeed in school

            <div class="title"><h3>Values</h3></div>
            <div class="values">
                <p>Read to a Child was founded on the belief that every child deserves to have a caring adult read to them on a regular basis.
                     Our strategy is based on the assumption that a lifelong love of reading is a driver of opportunity for children throughout their lives.
                     A caring relationship with a reading mentor promotes the attention,
                     engagement, and confidence that all children require to thrive.</p>
